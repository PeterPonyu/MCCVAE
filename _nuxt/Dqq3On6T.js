Many lineage states exhibited a distinctive tumor-associated expression profile, each contributing individually to a combined tumor-wide molecular collage. We observed increased plasma cell proportions as a feature of diffuse-type tumors associated with epithelial-resident KLF2, and a stagewise accrual of novel cancer-associated fibroblast sub-populations marked by high INHBA and FAP co-expression. Our results provide a high-resolution molecular resource for GC translational studies, identifying intra- and inter-patient lineage-states across distinct GC subtypes."},{"id":46,"title":"Single-cell analysis of childhood leukemia reveals a link between developmental states and ribosomal protein expression as a source of intra-individual heterogeneity","species":"Homo sapiens","author":"Caron M, St-Onge P, Sontag T, Wang YC, Richer C, Ragoussis I, Sinnett D, Bourque G","source":"ETV6-RUNX1","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 4000","accession":"GSE132509","description":"10X Genomics 3’ single cell RNA-seq: Pre-B t(12"},{"id":47,"title":"Characterization of cell fate probabilities in single-cell data with Palantir","species":"Homo sapiens","author":"Manu Setty, Vaidotas Kiseliovas, Jacob Levine, Adam Gayoso, Linas Mazutis & Dana Pe’er","source":"CD34-positive, CD38-negative hematopoietic stem cell","platform":"Human Cell Atlas data portal","accession":"S-SUBS8","description":"Differentiation is among the most fundamental processes in cell biology.

Modeling differentiation as a Markov chain, Palantir determines probabilities of reaching terminal states from cells in each intermediate state. The entropy of these probabilities represent the differentiation potential of the cell in the corresponding state. Applied to single cell RNA-seq dataset of CD34+ hematopoietic cells from human bone marrows, Palantir accurately identified key events leading up to cell fate commitment.

While ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic effects, overcoming resistance with immunotherapy becomes necessary when resistance develops. However, various clinical trials have revealed that their efficacies remain limited. To investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) factors contributing to poor immune checkpoint blockade responses in ALK-positive patients, we performed single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors with and without ALK rearrangements. Integrative analysis with additional public LUAD cohorts revealed distinct immune landscapes in ALK-positive tumors, marked by enriched innate immunity and depleted adaptive immunity. ALK-positive malignant cells exhibit higher stemness and aggressive phenotype. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in these tumors predominantly maintain pro-tumoral M2-like states, reinforcing immune suppression. B cells show reduced immune reactivity and impaired tertiary lymphoid structure formation, while CD8+ T cells display bystander-like signatures and reduced tumor reactivity. Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles combined with regulatory network analysis suggest that differences in transcription factor activities, rather than chromatin accessibility, may underlie T cell dysfunction. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive TME of ALK-positive LUAD, potentially explaining the failure of recent immunotherapy trials and highlighting targets for improving efficacy."},{"id":27,"title":"An enhancer-AAV toolbox to target and manipulate distinct interneuron subtypes [P28]","species":"Mus musculus","author":"Min Dai","source":"Cortex - ALM","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","accession":"GSE277242","description":"To identify potential cell type specific enhancers, we took advantage of the single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) data we have previously generated in the lab.
